<h1> Autofill Anki </h1>
 
<p>This is a code created for personal use with the objective of automatically
creating flashcards for Anki by using phrases and words gathered from PJO
which is a japanese online course. This code uses the Selenium package.</p>

<h3> What is Anki? </h3>
<p>Anki is a free open-source flashcard program that uses spaced repetition technique,
a much more efficient method for learning and remembering vocabulary than the traditional study means.</p>

<h3> What is JPO? </h3>
<p>JPO or "Programa JaponÃªs Online" is a language course for japanese learning in which 
each lesson a series of new phrases and vocabulary is presented and explained in detail.</p>

<p>One of the PJO course's guidelines is to add each new phrase and vocabulary presented
in each lesson to Anki as a flashcard, which can be quite a hassle considering each flashcard
contains a front and a back, hence the creation of Autofill Anki.</p>
